# Family Tree Java Solution

## Background
That is a classic family tree problem for
- adding children to existing tree
- showing relationships of a certain family member

## How to get it working?
- install java8 and maven
- run a build with `mvn clean install` in the root folder of the project
- run `java -jar geektrust.jar` from the project `target` folder

## How to test it?
- use `ADD_CHILD "MothersName" "ChildName" "Gender"` to add a child to the existing three
- use `GET_RELATIONSHIP "Name" "Relationsip"` to see relationship of a family member

## Further possible improvements
- synchronization
- cmd help/usage messages
- memory footprint
- algoritm optimization based on graph/vertex/node/relationship type with a matrix implemented
- abtracting some of the relationship visitors to reuse code

## Enjoy!
